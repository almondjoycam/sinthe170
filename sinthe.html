                With relatively little information presented explicitly in-game,
                it is difficult to classify the properties, mechanism of action,
                and other effects of Sinthe.
                The quoted information is taken from the
                character Navia's dialogue in the quest <em>The
                    Truth, Lost With the Rain</em>, transcribed on the <a

                what we know.

                    Sinthe is a <strong><a

                    <blockquote>
                        At a glance, it was a kind of drink that could excite
                        your mood and produce many pleasant hallucinations.
                    </blockquote>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sinthe is <strong>not a stimulant</strong>.
                    <blockquote>
                        If you drink Sinthe for an extended amount of time,
                        you'll suffer many side effects, such as losing the
                        ability to focus or control your emotions.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Sinthe causes <strong>both physiological and psychological
                        dependence</strong>.
                    <blockquote>
                        And if you were to stop drinking it completely... you'll
                        experience flashes of paranoia and anxiety, while lacking
                        energy to do anything. It's an extremely dangerous
                        substance.

            <p>
                Although Sinthe is a cultural reference to absinthe, it wouldn't
                necessarily be appropriate to assume that Sinthe possesses the
                same properties and mechanisms as its inspiration.
                In fact, it has been proven that absinthe itself does not have
                any effects apart from those expected of any alcoholic drink.
                The article <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC34311/"
                    target="_blank">Absinthe and
                    gamma-aminobutyric acid
                    receptors</a> provides an
                accessible review of the studies that have elaborated on such
                rumors about absinthe.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, the personal accounts of absinthe (and Sinthe) being
                hallucinogenic must have some basis. Some of these factors that
                might cause such effects to occur are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Impurities in the brewing process</li>
                <li>Concurrent use of another drug, e.g. opium</li>
                <li>Romantic literature trends in the 19th century, which often
                    described dream-like and surreal visions</li>
