                    target="_blank">Harm reduction</a> is an approach to drug
                use that aims to give substance users autonomy to live
                healthily. This can be considered the opposite of punitive drug
                policy, which criminalizes drug possession and use, and pushes
                substance users into a repeating cycle of incarceration and
                withdrawal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some harm reduction-focused solutions the Drug Policy Alliance,
                a US organization, is exploring include <a
                    href="https://drugpolicy.org/issue/legal-regulation-safer-supply/"
                    target="_blank">legal regulation and safer supply</a>.
                Proponents of this approach explain further that unregulated and
                illegal drug suppliers often sell mixed or impure products, and
                sometimes even falsely advertise products as a substance they
                are not. Legal regulation of a drug distribution market could
                significantly reduce false advertising, and safer supply of drug
                manufacturing could prevent impurities or unknown additives in
                products. Effects caused by combining two drugs in the body are
                called interactions, and sometimes, interactions can be
                life-threatening or fatal. By reducing the potential of these
                unknown interactions in drug suppliers, the risk of fatal
                interactions is also greatly reduced.

                In Fontaine, the main character learns through the region's
                quest that a man named Callas had been attempting to ban Sinthe
                entirely from the village of Poisson three years before the
                game's events. Poisson is a town that is located entirely
                underground, seemingly within a sewer system of metal piping,
                and is almost entirely comprised of Fontaine's working-class
                population. Callas had been in a government position within
                Poisson at that time, and had been in contact with one of the
                Sinthe dealers to try to gain information to help facilitate the
                shutting down of Sinthe manufacture. He was able to gain the
                location of the warehouse where Sinthe was being produced, but
                couldn't act on the information before he left office and died.
                By following the quest, the main character ties up this loose
                thread by visiting the warehouse location and collecting
                incriminating evidence in order to take legal action.
                Fortunately, there was only one man behind the operation, and by
                apprehending him, the entire production was halted. However,
                because no more Sinthe is being produced, the principles of
                legal regulation and safer supply can't exactly be applied.
