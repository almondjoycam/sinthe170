            <h2>How do we compare?</h2>
            <p>
                Before even beginning to compare Sinthe to other drug situations
                in the world, there are several assumptions that need to be made
                about the Sinthe situation. These may or may not be accurate,
                but all assumptions are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>People in Teyvat, the continent on which <em>Genshin
                        Impact</em> takes place, behave somewhat according to
                    human biology.</li>
                <li>&ldquo;Water from the Primordial Sea,&rdquo; a substance
                    said to originate naturally from the continent's waters, is
                    analogous to the active ingredient of Sinthe.</li>
                <li>The story emphasizes being from Fontaine as criteria, and so
                    susceptibility to Water from the Primordial Sea (and
                    therefore, developing a substance use disorder from Sinthe)
                    is strongly hereditary. The National Institute on Drug Abuse
                    supports this, saying that genetics and epigenetics play an
                    important role in the risk for developing substance use
                    disorders, according to <a
                        href="https://nida.nih.gov/publications/drugfacts/genetics-epigenetics-addiction"
                        target="_blank">a DrugFacts publication</a>.</li>
                <li>The act of dissolving from contact with Water from the
                    Primordial Sea is analogous to the lethal dosage.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                There are several points of comparison that I'd like to share
                between the drug of abuse in the given crisis and Sinthe. Some
                of these criteria are listed below.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>The drug must be predominately used recreationally.</li>
                <li>The drug is synthesized domestically in clandestine
                    laboratories.</li>
                <li>The drug crisis event is fueled by developing substance use
                    disorders (addictions) in a population.</li>
            </ul>
