            <h2>What can a fictional situation in a fantasy video game tell us
                about today's issues?</h2>
            <p>
                The popular video game <em>Genshin Impact</em> is a fantasy
                anime role-playing game, where different regions of the
                continent &mdash; called &ldquo;Teyvat&rdquo; &mdash; take
                cultural inspiration from different nations and eras in the
                real world. In the 4.0 update of the game, the main character
                travels to a nation called <em>Fontaine</em>, which is <a
                    href="https://genshin-impact.fandom.com/wiki/Fontaine#Cultural_References"
                    target="_blank">inspired
                    heavily by 19th century France</a>, also known as <a
                    href="http://www.la-belle-epoque.de/beintroe.html"
                    target="_blank"><em>La
                        belle epoque</em></a> (French for <em>beautiful
                    epoch</em>).
                One of the most memorable phenomena from this time was the
                popularization of <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/absinthe"
                    target="_blank"><em>absinthe</em></a>, an alcoholic drink
                infamous for its rumored hallucinogenic and aphrodisiac
                properties. A similar phenomenon exists in Fontaine that is
                appropriately named &ldquo;Sinthe,&rdquo; and this substance
                plays a major role in Fontaine's politics as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                Widespread use of psychoactive substances is a common thread
                that's potentially as old as humanity itself. For centuries,
                governments have turned themselves inside out to attempt to
                comprehend, control, and conquer drug use. Whether the situation
                is real or not, the Sinthe use (and abuse) in Fontaine has plenty
                of similarities to countless situations in the United States
                alone. The so-called <a
                    href="https://drugpolicy.org/drug-war-stats/"
                    target="_blank">&ldquo;war on drugs&rdquo; has impacted
                    millions,</a> and yet no previous &ldquo;solution&rdquo; has
                stopped it from <a
                    href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/opioid-overdose"
                    target="_blank">re-emerging in different forms.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                With a little suspension of disbelief, I believe that examining a
                fictional situation such as Sinthe in Fontaine can provide
                alternative approaches for enacting humane drug policy. As a
                result, this website will be presenting a public health plan for
                the Sinthe abuse crisis to <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Court of
                Fontaine based on historical drug crises in the United States.
                It will explain the fictional Sinthe crisis, some real-world
                drug crises in the United States, and a possible solution
                centered around public health.
                However, the content on this website will also reference
                <strong>major plot spoilers</strong> for the following main
