                    target="_blank">Harm reduction</a> is an approach to drug
                use that aims to give substance users autonomy to live
                healthily.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be considered the opposite of <em>punitive</em> drug
                policy, which criminalizes drug possession and use, and pushes
                substance users into a repeating cycle of incarceration and
                withdrawal.

            <h2>Legal Regulation and Safer Supply</h2>
            <p>
                The Drug Policy Alliance,
                a US organization, is exploring <a
                    href="https://drugpolicy.org/issue/legal-regulation-safer-supply/"
                    target="_blank">legal regulation and safer supply</a>.
                These are the main potential benefits of this approach.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Increased transparency in ingredient listing.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Unregulated and illegal drug suppliers often sell mixed or
                    impure products. Safer supply of drug manufacturing could
                    prevent impurities or unknown additives in products.
                    Reducing the potential of drug additives also reduces the
                    risk of serious or fatal drug interactions.
                </dd>
                <dt>Stricter marketing rules.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Sometimes, vendors falsely advertise their products as a
                    substance they are not. Legal regulation of a drug
                    distribution market could significantly reduce false
                    advertising.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                If a drug is legally regulated, it is bound to the Code of
                Federal
                Regulations (CFR). <a
                    href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-201/subpart-A/section-201.10"
                    target="_blank">Title 21 of the CFR, section 201.10</a>
                details federal
                regulations on listing the ingredients of a drug prominently on
                the label,
                without any misleading information.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the events of Fontaine's main quest, the main character
                helps bring the Sinthe manufacturer to justice, shutting
                down production completely. However, because no more Sinthe is
                being produced, the approaches of legal regulation and
                safer supply can't exactly be applied.
            </p>
            <h2>Medication-Assisted Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                Because psychoactive drugs can permanently alter the chemistry
                of the brain, it's often harmful and counterproductive to
                completely stop taking a substance when someone has developed a
                dependence. Unfortunately, for the people of Fontaine, there are
                very limited options when the source of the substance itself has
                been removed. As a result, anyone in Fontaine left with a Sinthe
                addiction will start experiencing <a
                    href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK459239/"
                    target="_blank">withdrawal symptoms</a>, some of which could
                be serious or even fatal.
            </p>

                Treatment for substance use disorder is most often a combination
                of therapy and medications. In the U.S., the Substance Abuse and
                Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) provides
                information about <a
                    href="https://www.samhsa.gov/medications-substance-use-disorders/medications-counseling-related-conditions"
                    target="_blank">medications for substance use disorder</a>,
                and mentions that they are most effective in combination with
                counseling. <a
                    href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-42/chapter-I/subchapter-A/part-8#8.12"
                    target="_blank">Title 42 of the CFR</a> mandates that
                federal opioid treatment programs must include adequate
                counseling services.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's important to note that <strong>the efficacy of treatment
                    programs is dependent on the patient's motivation to
                    participate.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Specific medications for treatment depend on the precise
                chemistry and mechanisms of Sinthe, which cannot be determined.
                However, the medications listed on the SAMHSA website all act
                primarily on the brain's opioid system, which is responsible for
                feelings of euphoria. They are summarized as follows.

                <dd>
                    Acamprosate is a medication for alcohol use disorder. It's
                    used specifically in maintaining abstinence, and helps
                    patients avoid drinking. How exactly it does this is not yet
                    understood.

                <dd>
                    Disulfiram is an alcohol antagonist to treat chronic alcohol
                    use disorder. If it interacts with alcohol in the body,
                    extremely unpleasant reactions occur.

                <dd>
                    Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that is also being
                    explored in treating alcohol use disorder. It blocks the
                    euphoric effects of opiates and alcohol, but also reduces
                    tolerance. This can lead to a much higher chance of
                    overdose. Articles exploring naltrexone in alcohol use
                    disorder specifically are listed below.

                <dd>
                    Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist. It binds to the
                    same receptors as many opiates, but does not produce the
                    rewarding effects. This can help reduce cravings for opiate
                    drugs.

                <dd>
                    Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is used to
                    treat opioid addiction. It behaves similar to morphine,
                    another kind of opiate, and reduces the effects of taking
                    opiate drugs.
                </dd>
                <dt><a href="https://dailymed.nlm.nih.gov/dailymed/drugInfo.cfm?setid=f4373402-d796-ad6a-e053-2995a90aec86"

                <dd>
                    Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse the
                    effects of opioid drugs in case of an overdose. It is also
                    combined with buprenorphine as a treatment regimen.

            <p>
                The above drugs have all been tested and FDA-approved. The
                presence of such substances in Teyvat and the efficacy of these
                drugs in the people of Fontaine are both completely uncertain,
                though. A lot of research would have to be conducted by the
                Fontaine government in order to find an effective treatment
                plan.
