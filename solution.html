                    target="_blank">Harm reduction</a> is an approach to drug
                use that aims to give substance users autonomy to live
                healthily.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can be considered the opposite of <em>punitive</em> drug
                policy, which criminalizes drug possession and use, and pushes
                substance users into a repeating cycle of incarceration and
                withdrawal.

            <h2>Legal Regulation and Safer Supply</h2>
            <p>
                The Drug Policy Alliance,
                a US organization, is exploring <a
                    href="https://drugpolicy.org/issue/legal-regulation-safer-supply/"
                    target="_blank">legal regulation and safer supply</a>.
                These are the main potential benefits of this approach.
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Increased transparency in ingredient listing.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Unregulated and illegal drug suppliers often sell mixed or
                    impure products. Safer supply of drug manufacturing could
                    prevent impurities or unknown additives in products.
                    Reducing the potential of drug additives also reduces the
                    risk of serious or fatal drug interactions.
                </dd>
                <dt>Stricter marketing rules.</dt>
                <dd>
                    Sometimes, vendors falsely advertise their products as a
                    substance they are not. Legal regulation of a drug
                    distribution market could significantly reduce false
                    advertising.
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <p>
                If a drug is legally regulated, it is bound to the Code of
                Federal
                Regulations (CFR). <a
                    href="https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-21/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-201/subpart-A/section-201.10"
                    target="_blank">Title 21 of the CFR, section 201.10</a>
                details federal
                regulations on listing the ingredients of a drug prominently on
                the label,
                without any misleading information.
            </p>

                During the events of Fontaine's main quest, the main character
                helps bring the Sinthe manufacturer to justice, shutting
                down production completely. However, because no more Sinthe is
                being produced, the approaches of legal regulation and
                safer supply can't exactly be applied.
